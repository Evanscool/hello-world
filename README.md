The inspiration for my website was very obvius from the start. With this week learning all of these cool new animations I wanted to make myself a youtube page. 
I wanted to impliment cool features like a subscribe button that changes color when you hover over it, and also a spinning wheile representing loading.
I am very satisfied with my website and the cool animations I have included.
